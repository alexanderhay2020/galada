My name is Alex Hay. I'm currently a masters student of robotics at Northwestern University in Chicago. My passion lies in prosthetics and learning new ways to mimic human ability.

#### Pearce Services - Design Engineer...
<small>2014 - 2019</small>

I coordinated with the lead engineer, field engineer, and other contractors to move the project forward in a timely but comprehensive manner.
